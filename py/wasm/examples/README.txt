Nitro apps in your browser!
===========================

This directory contains a small selection of sample H2O Nitro[1] apps that run entirely in your browser, using Pyodide[2].

To view these examples, make sure you are opening this directory's HTML files from a web server, and not directly from your computer's file system. 

A simple way to do that is to open a terminal, change to this directory, and run:

    python -m http.server 8000

Then, navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

Happy hacking!
